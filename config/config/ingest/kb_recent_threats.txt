DESCRIPTION: Nagios XI versions prior to 2012R1.3 contain a SQL injection vulnerability in the legacy Core Configuration Manager (CCM) interface. Authenticated users could manipulate SQL queries by supplying crafted input to specific CCM parameters, potentially allowing access to configuration data stored in the application database. Successful exploitation could disclose or modify notification data and, in some cases, impact the application database more broadly.

DESCRIPTION: Nagios XI versions prior to 2024R1.1.2 contain a missing authorization control when the 'Allow Insecure Logins' option is enabled. Under this configuration, any user can create valid login credentials for other users without proper authorization. This can lead to unauthorized account creation, privilege escalation, or full compromise of the Nagios XI web interface depending on the target account.

DESCRIPTION: Nagios XI versions prior to 2024R1.1.3 did not invalidate all other active sessions for a user when that user's password was changed. As a result, any pre-existing sessions (including those potentially controlled by an attacker) remained valid after a credential update.

DESCRIPTION: Nagios Log Server versions prior to 2024R2.0.3 contain an execution with unnecessary privileges vulnerability as it runs its embedded Logstash process as the root user. If an attacker is able to compromise the Logstash process - for example by exploiting an insecure plugin, pipeline configuration injection, or a vulnerability in input parsing - the attacker could execute code with root privileges, resulting in full system compromise. The Logstash service has been altered to run as the lower-privileged 'nagios' user to reduce this risk associated with a network-facing service that can accept untrusted input or load third-party components.

DESCRIPTION: A vulnerability in the Contact Center Express (CCX) Editor application of Cisco Unified CCX could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication and obtain administrative permissions pertaining to script creation and execution.

This vulnerability is due to improper authentication mechanisms in the communication between the CCX Editor and an affected Unified CCX server. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by redirecting the authentication flow to a malicious server and tricking the CCX Editor into believing the authentication was successful. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create and execute arbitrary scripts on the underlying operating system of an affected Unified CCX server, as an internal non-root user account.
