NAME: exploit/linux/samba/chain_reply
TYPE: exploit
RANK: good
ARCH: []
PLATFORM: Linux
KEYWORDS: linux samba chain_reply exploit
DESCRIPTION: This exploits a memory corruption vulnerability present in Samba versions prior to 3.3.13. When handling chained response packets, Samba fails to validate the offset value used when building the next part. By setting this value to a number larger than the destination buffer size, an attacker can corrupt memory. Additionally, setting this value to a value smaller than 'smb_wct' (0x24) will cause the header of the input buffer chunk to be corrupted. After close inspection, it appears that 3.0.x versions of Samba are not exploitable. Since they use an "InputBuffer" size of 0x20441, an attacker cannot cause memory to be corrupted in an exploitable way. It is possible to corrupt the heap header of the "InputBuffer", but it didn't seem possible to get the chunk to be processed again prior to process exit. In order to gain code execution, this exploit attempts to overwrite a "talloc chunk" destructor function pointer. This particular module is capable of exploiting the flaw on x86 Linux systems that do not have the nx memory protection. NOTE: It is possible to make exploitation attempts indefinitely since Samba forks for user sessions in the default configuration.

NAME: exploit/windows/fileformat/ms14_060_sandworm
TYPE: exploit
RANK: excellent
ARCH: x86
PLATFORM: Windows
KEYWORDS: windows fileformat ms14_060_sandworm exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits a vulnerability found in Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) allowing arbitrary code execution, publicly known as "Sandworm". Platforms such as Windows Vista SP2 all the way to Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 and 2012 are known to be vulnerable. However, based on our testing, the most reliable setup is on Windows platforms running Office 2013 and Office 2010 SP2. And please keep in mind that some other setups such as using Office 2010 SP1 might be less stable, and sometimes may end up with a crash due to a failure in the CPackage::CreateTempFileName function. This module will generate three files: an INF, a GIF, and a PPSX file. You are required to set up a SMB or Samba 3 server and host the INF and GIF there. Systems such as Ubuntu or an older version of Windows (such as XP) work best for this because they require little configuration to get going. The PPSX file is what you should send to your target. In detail, the vulnerability has to do with how the Object Packager 2 component (packager.dll) handles an INF file that contains malicious registry changes, which may be leveraged for code execution. First of all, Packager does not load the INF file directly. As an attacker, you can trick it to load your INF anyway by embedding the file path as a remote share in an OLE object. The packager will then treat it as a type of media file, and load it with the packager!CPackage::OLE2MPlayerReadFromStream function, which will download it with a CopyFileW call, save it in a temp folder, and pass that information for later. The exploit will do this loading process twice: first for a fake gif file that's actually the payload, and the second for the INF file. The packager will also look at each OLE object's XML Presentation Command, specifically the type and cmd property. In the exploit, "verb" media command type is used, and this triggers the packager!CPackage::DoVerb function. Also, "-3" is used as the fake gif file's cmd property, and "3" is used for the INF. When the cmd is "-3", DoVerb will bail. But when "3" is used (again, for the INF file), it will cause the packager to try to find appropriate handler for it, which will end up with C:\Windows\System32\infDefaultInstall.exe, and that will install/run the malicious INF file, and finally give us arbitrary code execution.

DESCRIPTION: ManageEngine Password Manager Pro (PMP) has an authenticated blind SQL injection vulnerability in SQLAdvancedALSearchResult.cc that can be abused to escalate privileges and obtain Super Administrator access. A Super Administrator can then use his privileges to dump the whole password database in CSV format. PMP can use both MySQL and PostgreSQL databases but this module only exploits the latter as MySQL does not support stacked queries with Java. PostgreSQL is the default database in v6.8 and above, but older PMP versions can be upgraded and continue using MySQL, so a higher version does not guarantee exploitability. This module has been tested on v6.8 to v7.1 build 7104 on both Windows and Linux. The vulnerability is fixed in v7.1 build 7105 and above.

DESCRIPTION: This module exploits an unauthenticated blind SQL injection in LinkViewFetchServlet, which is exposed in ManageEngine Desktop Central v7 build 70200 to v9 build 90033 and Password Manager Pro v6 build 6500 to v7 build 7002 (including the MSP versions). The SQL injection can be used to achieve remote code execution as SYSTEM in Windows or as the user in Linux. This module exploits both PostgreSQL (newer builds) and MySQL (older or upgraded builds). MySQL targets are more reliable due to the use of relative paths; with PostgreSQL you should find the web root path via other means and specify it with WEB_ROOT. The injection is only exploitable via a GET request, which means that the payload has to be sent in chunks smaller than 8000 characters (URL size limitation). Small payloads and the use of exe-small is recommended, as you can only do between 10 and 20 injections before using up all the available ManagedConnections until the next server restart. This vulnerability exists in all versions released since 2006, however builds below DC v7 70200 and PMP v6 6500 do not ship with a JSP compiler. You can still try your luck using the MySQL targets as a JDK might be installed in the $PATH.

DESCRIPTION: Grab secrets and keys from the vCenter server and add them to loot. This module is tested against the vCenter appliance only; it will not work on Windows vCenter instances. It is intended to be run after successfully acquiring root access on a vCenter appliance and is useful for penetrating further into the environment following a vCenter exploit that results in a root shell. Secrets include the dcAccountDN and dcAccountPassword for the vCenter machine which can be used for maniuplating the SSO domain via standard LDAP interface; good for plugging into the vmware_vcenter_vmdir_ldap module or for adding new SSO admin users. The MACHINE_SSL, VMCA_ROOT and SSO IdP certificates with associated private keys are also plundered and can be used to sign forged SAML assertions for the /ui admin interface.

KEYWORDS: multi misc wireshark_lwres_getaddrbyname exploit
DESCRIPTION: The LWRES dissector in Wireshark version 0.9.15 through 1.0.10 and 1.2.0 through 1.2.5 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code due to a stack-based buffer overflow. This bug found and reported by babi. This particular exploit targets the dissect_getaddrsbyname_request function. Several other functions also contain potentially exploitable stack-based buffer overflows. The Windows version (of 1.2.5 at least) is compiled with /GS, which prevents exploitation via the return address on the stack. Sending a larger string allows exploitation using the SEH bypass method. However, this packet will usually get fragmented, which may cause additional complications. NOTE: The vulnerable code is reached only when the packet dissection is rendered. If the packet is fragmented, all fragments must be captured and reassembled to exploit this issue.

DESCRIPTION: IBM Data Risk Manager (IDRM) contains two vulnerabilities that can be chained by an unauthenticated attacker to download arbitrary files off the system. The first is an unauthenticated bypass, followed by a path traversal. This module exploits both vulnerabilities, giving an attacker the ability to download (non-root) files. A downloaded file is zipped, and this module also unzips it before storing it in the database. By default this module downloads Tomcat's application.properties files, which contains the database password, amongst other sensitive data. At the time of disclosure, this is was a 0 day, but IBM later patched it and released their advisory. Versions 2.0.2 to 2.0.4 are vulnerable, version 2.0.1 is not.

NAME: auxiliary/admin/http/tomcat_ghostcat
TYPE: auxiliary
RANK: normal
ARCH: []
PLATFORM: []
KEYWORDS: admin http tomcat_ghostcat auxiliary
DESCRIPTION: When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP. Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to make small changes to their configurations.

DESCRIPTION: This module can be used to obtain a list of all logins from a SQL Server with any login. Selecting all of the logins from the master..syslogins table is restricted to sysadmins. However, logins with the PUBLIC role (everyone) can quickly enumerate all SQL Server logins using the SUSER_SNAME function by fuzzing the principal_id parameter. This is pretty simple, because the principal IDs assigned to logins are incremental. Once logins have been enumerated they can be verified via sp_defaultdb error analysis. This is important, because not all of the principal IDs resolve to SQL logins (some resolve to roles instead). Once logins have been enumerated, they can be used in dictionary attacks.

KEYWORDS: admin mssql mssql_ntlm_stealer auxiliary
DESCRIPTION: This module can be used to help capture or relay the LM/NTLM credentials of the account running the remote SQL Server service. The module will use the supplied credentials to connect to the target SQL Server instance and execute the native "xp_dirtree" or "xp_fileexist" stored procedure. The stored procedures will then force the service account to authenticate to the system defined in the SMBProxy option. In order for the attack to be successful, the SMB capture or relay module must be running on the system defined as the SMBProxy. The database account used to connect to the database should only require the "PUBLIC" role to execute. Successful execution of this attack usually results in local administrative access to the Windows system. Specifically, this works great for relaying credentials between two SQL Servers using a shared service account to get shells. However, if the relay fails, then the LM hash can be reversed using the Halflm rainbow tables and john the ripper. Thanks to "Sh2kerr" who wrote the ora_ntlm_stealer for the inspiration.

Although this attack requires authentication, there are several factors that increase the severity of this vulnerability. 1. OpenNMS runs with root privileges, taken from the OpenNMS FAQ: "The difficulty with the core of OpenNMS is that these components need to run as root to be able to bind to low-numbered ports or generate network traffic that requires root" 2. The user that you must authenticate as is the "rtc" user which has the default password of "rtc". There is no mention of this user in the installation guides found here: http://www.opennms.org/wiki/Tutorial_Installation, only mention that you should change the default admin password of "admin" for security purposes.

DESCRIPTION: Several Dlink routers contain a pre-authentication stack buffer overflow vulnerability, which is exposed on the LAN interface on port 80. This vulnerability affects the HNAP SOAP protocol, which accepts arbitrarily long strings into certain XML parameters and then copies them into the stack. This exploit has been tested on the real devices DIR-818LW and 868L (rev. B), and it was tested using emulation on the DIR-822, 823, 880, 885, 890 and 895. Others might be affected, and this vulnerability is present in both MIPS and ARM devices. The MIPS devices are powered by Lextra RLX processors, which are crippled MIPS cores lacking a few load and store instructions. Because of this the payloads have to be sent unencoded, which can cause them to fail, although the bind shell seems to work well. For the ARM devices, the inline reverse tcp seems to work best. Check the reference links to see the vulnerable firmware versions.

DESCRIPTION: This modules exploits a buffer overflow in the Quest Privilege Manager, a software used to integrate Active Directory with Linux and Unix systems. The vulnerability exists in the pmmasterd daemon, and can only triggered when the host has been configured as a policy server ( Privilege Manager for Unix or Quest Sudo Plugin). A buffer overflow condition exists when handling requests of type ACT_ALERT_EVENT, where the size of a memcpy can be controlled by the attacker. This module only works against version < 6.0.0-27. Versions up to 6.0.0-50 are also vulnerable, but not supported by this module (a stack cookie bypass is required). NOTE: To use this module it is required to be able to bind a privileged port ( <=1024 ) as the server refuses connections coming from unprivileged ports, which in most situations means that root privileges are required.

TYPE: exploit
RANK: excellent
ARCH: x86', 'x64
PLATFORM: Windows
KEYWORDS: windows misc ais_esel_server_rce exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module will execute an arbitrary payload on an "ESEL" server used by the AIS logistic software. The server typically listens on port 5099 without TLS. There could also be server listening on 5100 with TLS but the port 5099 is usually always open. The login process is vulnerable to an SQL Injection. Usually a MSSQL Server with the 'sa' user is in place. This module was verified on version 67 but it should also run on lower versions. An fixed version was created by AIS in September 2017. However most systems have not been updated. In regard to the payload, unless there is a closed port in the web server, you dont want to use any "bind" payload. You want a "reverse" payload, probably to your port 80 or to any other outbound port allowed on the firewall. Currently, one delivery method is supported This method takes advantage of the Command Stager subsystem. This allows using various techniques, such as using a TFTP server, to send the executable. By default the Command Stager uses 'wcsript.exe' to generate the executable on the target. NOTE: This module will leave a payload executable on the target system when the attack is finished.

DESCRIPTION: This module can be used to crawl MS SQL Server database links and deploy Metasploit payloads through links configured with sysadmin privileges using a valid SQL Server Login. If you are attempting to obtain multiple reverse shells using this module we recommend setting the "DisablePayloadHandler" advanced option to "true", and setting up a exploit/multi/handler to run in the background as a job to support multiple incoming shells. If you are interested in deploying payloads to specific servers this module also supports that functionality via the "DEPLOYLIST" option. Currently, the module is capable of delivering payloads to both 32bit and 64bit Windows systems via powershell memory injection methods based on Matthew Graeber's work. As a result, the target server must have powershell installed. By default, all of the crawl information is saved to a CSV formatted log file and MSF loot so that the tool can also be used for auditing without deploying payloads.

NAME: exploit/windows/mssql/mssql_payload_sqli
TYPE: exploit
RANK: excellent
ARCH: x86', 'x64
PLATFORM: Windows
KEYWORDS: windows mssql mssql_payload_sqli exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module will execute an arbitrary payload on a Microsoft SQL Server, using a SQL injection vulnerability. Once a vulnerability is identified this module will use xp_cmdshell to upload and execute Metasploit payloads. It is necessary to specify the exact point where the SQL injection vulnerability happens. For example, given the following injection: http://www.example.com/show.asp?id=1;exec xp_cmdshell 'dir';--&cat=electrical you would need to set the following path: set GET_PATH /showproduct.asp?id=1;[SQLi];--&cat=foobar In regard to the payload, unless there is a closed port in the web server, you dont want to use any "bind" payload, specially on port 80, as you will stop reaching the vulnerable web server host. You want a "reverse" payload, probably to your port 80 or to any other outbound port allowed on the firewall. For privileged ports execute Metasploit msfconsole as root. Currently, three delivery methods are supported. First, the original method uses Windows 'debug.com'. File size restrictions are avoided by incorporating the debug bypass method presented by SecureStat at Defcon 17. Since this method invokes ntvdm, it is not available on x64 systems. A second method takes advantage of the Command Stager subsystem. This allows using various techniques, such as using a TFTP server, to send the executable. By default the Command Stager uses 'wcsript.exe' to generate the executable on the target. Finally, ReL1K's latest method utilizes PowerShell to transmit and recreate the payload on the target. NOTE: This module will leave a payload executable on the target system when the attack is finished.

NAME: exploit/windows/pop3/seattlelab_pass
TYPE: exploit

ARCH: []
PLATFORM: Windows
KEYWORDS: windows pop3 seattlelab_pass exploit
DESCRIPTION: There exists an unauthenticated buffer overflow vulnerability in the POP3 server of Seattle Lab Mail 5.5 when sending a password with excessive length. Successful exploitation should not crash either the service or the server; however, after initial use the port cannot be reused for successive exploitation until the service has been restarted. Consider using a command execution payload following the bind shell to restart the service if you need to reuse the same port. The overflow appears to occur in the debugging/error reporting section of the slmail.exe executable, and there are multiple offsets that will lead to successful exploitation. This exploit uses 2606, the offset that creates the smallest overall payload. The other offset is 4654. The return address is overwritten with a "jmp esp" call from the application library SLMFC.DLL found in %SYSTEM%\system32\. This return address works against all version of Windows and service packs. The last modification date on the library is dated 06/02/99. Assuming that the code where the overflow occurs has not changed in some time, prior version of SLMail may also be vulnerable with this exploit. The author has not been able to acquire older versions of SLMail for testing purposes. Please let us know if you were able to get this exploit working against other SLMail versions.

KEYWORDS: dos http apache_mod_isapi auxiliary
DESCRIPTION: This module triggers a use-after-free vulnerability in the Apache Software Foundation mod_isapi extension for versions 2.2.14 and earlier. In order to reach the vulnerable code, the target server must have an ISAPI module installed and configured. By making a request that terminates abnormally (either an aborted TCP connection or an unsatisfied chunked request), mod_isapi will unload the ISAPI extension. Later, if another request comes for that ISAPI module, previously obtained pointers will be used resulting in an access violation or potentially arbitrary code execution. Although arbitrary code execution is theoretically possible, a real-world method of invoking this consequence has not been proven. In order to do so, one would need to find a situation where a particular ISAPI module loads at an image base address that can be re-allocated by a remote attacker. Limited success was encountered using two separate ISAPI modules. In this scenario, a second ISAPI module was loaded into the same memory area as the previously unloaded module.

KEYWORDS: linux http apache_spark_rce_cve_2022_33891 exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in Apache Spark. Successful exploitation results in remote code execution under the context of the Spark application user. The command injection occurs because Spark checks the group membership of the user passed in the ?doAs parameter by using a raw Linux command. It is triggered by a non-default setting called spark.acls.enable. This configuration setting spark.acls.enable should be set true in the Spark configuration to make the application vulnerable for this attack. Apache Spark versions 3.0.3 and earlier, versions 3.1.1 to 3.1.2, and versions 3.2.0 to 3.2.1 are affected by this vulnerability.

KEYWORDS: linux http apache_superset_cookie_sig_rce exploit
DESCRIPTION: Apache Superset versions <= 2.0.0 utilize Flask with a known default secret key which is used to sign HTTP cookies. These cookies can therefore be forged. If a user is able to login to the site, they can decode the cookie, set their user_id to that of an administrator, and re-sign the cookie. This valid cookie can then be used to login as the targeted user. From there the Superset database is mounted, and credentials are pulled. A dashboard is then created. Lastly a pickled python payload can be set for that dashboard within Superset's database which will trigger the RCE. An attempt to clean up ALL of the dashboard key values and reset them to their previous values happens during the cleanup phase.

KEYWORDS: linux http eyesofnetwork_autodiscovery_rce exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities in EyesOfNetwork version 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 in order to execute arbitrary commands as root. This module takes advantage of a command injection vulnerability in the `target` parameter of the AutoDiscovery functionality within the EON web interface in order to write an Nmap NSE script containing the payload to disk. It then starts an Nmap scan to activate the payload. This results in privilege escalation because the`apache` user can execute Nmap as root. Valid credentials for a user with administrative privileges are required. However, this module can bypass authentication via various methods, depending on the EON version. EON 5.3 is vulnerable to a hardcoded API key and two SQL injection exploits. EON 5.1 and 5.2 can only be exploited via SQL injection. This module has been successfully tested on EyesOfNetwork 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3.

DESCRIPTION: This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities in rConfig version 3.9 in order to execute arbitrary commands. This module takes advantage of a command injection vulnerability in the `path` parameter of the ajax archive file functionality within the rConfig web interface in order to execute the payload. Valid credentials for a user with administrative privileges are required. However, this module can bypass authentication via SQLI. This module has been successfully tested on Rconfig 3.9.3 and 3.9.4. The steps are: 1. SQLi on /commands.inc.php allows us to add an administrative user. 2. An authenticated session is established with the newly added user 3. Command Injection on /lib/ajaxHandlers/ajaxArchiveFiles.php allows us to execute the payload. 4. Remove the added admin user. Tips : once you get a shell, look at the CVE-2019-19585. You will probably get root because rConfig install script add Apache user to sudoers with nopasswd ;-)

PLATFORM: Python
KEYWORDS: linux http trendmicro_websecurity_exec exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities together in order to achive a remote code execution. Unauthenticated users can execute a terminal command under the context of the root user. The specific flaw exists within the LogSettingHandler class of administrator interface software. When parsing the mount_device parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. But authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. Another specific flaw exist within the proxy service, which listens on port 8080 by default. Unauthenticated users can exploit this vulnerability in order to communicate with internal services in the product. Last but not least a flaw exists within the Apache Solr application, which is installed within the product. When parsing the file parameter, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied path prior to using it in file operations. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose information in the context of the IWSS user. Due to combination of these vulnerabilities, unauthenticated users can execute a terminal command under the context of the root user. Version perior to 6.5 SP2 Patch 4 (Build 1901) are affected.

NAME: exploit/linux/smtp/apache_james_exec
TYPE: exploit
RANK: normal
ARCH: x86', 'x64
PLATFORM: Linux
KEYWORDS: linux smtp apache_james_exec exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits a vulnerability that exists due to a lack of input validation when creating a user. Messages for a given user are stored in a directory partially defined by the username. By creating a user with a directory traversal payload as the username, commands can be written to a given directory. To use this module with the cron exploitation method, run the exploit using the given payload, host, and port. After running the exploit, the payload will be executed within 60 seconds. Due to differences in how cron may run in certain Linux operating systems such as Ubuntu, it may be preferable to set the target to Bash Completion as the cron method may not work. If the target is set to Bash completion, start a listener using the given payload, host, and port before running the exploit. After running the exploit, the payload will be executed when a user logs into the system. For this exploitation method, bash completion must be enabled to gain code execution. This exploitation method will leave an Apache James mail object artifact in the /etc/bash_completion.d directory and the malicious user account.

DESCRIPTION: This exploit takes advantage of the StringSubstitutor interpolator class, which is included in the Commons Text library. A default interpolator allows for string lookups that can lead to Remote Code Execution. This is due to a logic flaw that makes the “script”, “dns” and “url” lookup keys interpolated by default, as opposed to what it should be, according to the documentation of the StringLookupFactory class. Those keys allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code via lookups primarily using the "script" key. In order to exploit the vulnerabilities, the following requirements must be met: Run a version of Apache Commons Text from version 1.5 to 1.9 Use the StringSubstitutor interpolator Target should run JDK < 15

KEYWORDS: multi http apache_druid_cve_2023_25194 exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module is designed to exploit the JNDI injection vulnerability in Druid. The vulnerability specifically affects the indexer/v1/sampler interface of Druid, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the targeted server. The vulnerability is found in Apache Kafka clients versions ranging from 2.3.0 to 3.3.2. If an attacker can manipulate the sasl.jaas.config property of any of the connector's Kafka clients to com.sun.security.auth.module.JndiLoginModule, it allows the server to establish a connection with the attacker's LDAP server and deserialize the LDAP response. This provides the attacker with the capability to execute java deserialization gadget chains on the Kafka connect server, potentially leading to unrestricted deserialization of untrusted data or even remote code execution (RCE) if there are relevant gadgets in the classpath. To facilitate the exploitation process, this module will initiate an LDAP server that the target server needs to connect to in order to carry out the attack.

DESCRIPTION: Versions of Apache Log4j2 impacted by CVE-2021-44228 which allow JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters, do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. This module will exploit an HTTP end point with the Log4Shell vulnerability by injecting a format message that will trigger an LDAP connection to Metasploit and load a payload. The Automatic target delivers a Java payload using remote class loading. This requires Metasploit to run an HTTP server in addition to the LDAP server that the target can connect to. The targeted application must have the trusted code base option enabled for this technique to work. The non-Automatic targets deliver a payload via a serialized Java object. This does not require Metasploit to run an HTTP server and instead leverages the LDAP server to deliver the serialized object. The target application in this case must be compatible with the user-specified JAVA_GADGET_CHAIN option.

KEYWORDS: multi http struts_include_params exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits a remote command execution vulnerability in Apache Struts versions < 2.3.14.2. A specifically crafted request parameter can be used to inject arbitrary OGNL code into the stack bypassing Struts and OGNL library protections. When targeting an action which requires interaction through GET, the payload should be split, taking into account the URI limits. In this case, if the rendered JSP has more than one point of injection, it could result in payload corruption. This should happen only when the payload is larger than the URI length.

The vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to reveal the password for the admin user that is used to log into the router's administrative portal, in plaintext. Once the password has been been obtained, the exploit enables telnet on the target router and then utiltizes the auxiliary/scanner/telnet/telnet_login module to log into the router using the stolen credentials of the admin user. This will result in the attacker obtaining a new telnet session as the "root" user. This vulnerability was discovered and exploited by an independent security researcher who reported it to SSD.

KEYWORDS: admin http netgear_r6700_pass_reset auxiliary
DESCRIPTION: This module targets ZDI-20-704 (aka CVE-2020-10924), a buffer overflow vulnerability in the UPNP daemon (/usr/sbin/upnpd), on Netgear R6700v3 routers running firmware versions from V1.0.2.62 up to but not including V1.0.4.94, to reset the password for the 'admin' user back to its factory default of 'password'. Authentication is bypassed by using ZDI-20-703 (aka CVE-2020-10923), an authentication bypass that occurs when network adjacent computers send SOAPAction UPnP messages to a vulnerable Netgear R6700v3 router. Currently this module only supports exploiting Netgear R6700v3 routers running either the V1.0.0.4.82_10.0.57 or V1.0.0.4.84_10.0.58 firmware, however support for other firmware versions may be added in the future. Once the password has been reset, attackers can use the exploit/linux/telnet/netgear_telnetenable module to send a special packet to port 23/udp of the router to enable a telnet server on port 23/tcp. The attacker can then log into this telnet server using the new password, and obtain a shell as the "root" user. These last two steps have to be done manually, as the authors did not reverse the communication with the web interface. It should be noted that successful exploitation will result in the upnpd binary crashing on the target router. As the upnpd binary will not restart until the router is rebooted, this means that attackers can only exploit this vulnerability once per reboot of the router. This vulnerability was discovered and exploited at Pwn2Own Tokyo 2019 by the Flashback team (Pedro Ribeiro + Radek Domanski).

KEYWORDS: linux ftp proftp_telnet_iac exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in versions of ProFTPD server between versions 1.3.2rc3 and 1.3.3b. By sending data containing a large number of Telnet IAC commands, an attacker can corrupt memory and execute arbitrary code. The Debian Squeeze version of the exploit uses a little ROP stub to indirectly transfer the flow of execution to a pool buffer (the cmd_rec "res" in "pr_cmd_read"). The Ubuntu version uses a ROP stager to mmap RWX memory, copy a small stub to it, and execute the stub. The stub then copies the remainder of the payload in and executes it. NOTE: Most Linux distributions either do not ship a vulnerable version of ProFTPD, or they ship a version compiled with stack smashing protection. Although SSP significantly reduces the probability of a single attempt succeeding, it will not prevent exploitation. Since the daemon forks in a default configuration, the cookie value will remain the same despite some attempts failing. By making repeated requests, an attacker can eventually guess the cookie value and exploit the vulnerability. The cookie in Ubuntu has 24-bits of entropy. This reduces the effectiveness and could allow exploitation in semi-reasonable amount of time.

NAME: exploit/linux/http/asuswrt_lan_rce
TYPE: exploit
RANK: excellent
ARCH: cmd
PLATFORM: Unix
KEYWORDS: linux http asuswrt_lan_rce exploit
DESCRIPTION: The HTTP server in AsusWRT has a flaw where it allows an unauthenticated client to perform a POST in certain cases. This can be combined with another vulnerability in the VPN configuration upload routine that sets NVRAM configuration variables directly from the POST request to enable a special command mode. This command mode can then be abused by sending a UDP packet to infosvr, which is running on port UDP 9999 to directly execute commands as root. This exploit leverages that to start telnetd in a random port, and then connects to it. It has been tested with the RT-AC68U running AsusWRT Version 3.0.0.4.380.7743.

KEYWORDS: linux http dlink_diagnostic_exec_noauth exploit
DESCRIPTION: Some D-Link Routers are vulnerable to OS Command injection in the web interface. On DIR-645 versions prior 1.03 authentication isn't needed to exploit it. On version 1.03 authentication is needed in order to trigger the vulnerability, which has been fixed definitely on version 1.04. Other D-Link products, like DIR-300 rev B and DIR-600, are also affected by this vulnerability. Not every device includes wget which we need for deploying our payload. On such devices you could use the cmd generic payload and try to start telnetd or execute other commands. Since it is a blind OS command injection vulnerability, there is no output for the executed command when using the cmd generic payload. A ping command against a controlled system could be used for testing purposes. This module has been tested successfully on DIR-645 prior to 1.03, where authentication isn't needed in order to exploit the vulnerability.

DESCRIPTION: This module exploits a command injection vulnerability in the Huawei HG532n routers provided by TE-Data Egypt, leading to a root shell. The router's web interface has two kinds of logins, a "limited" user:user login given to all customers and an admin mode. The limited mode is used here to expose the router's telnet port to the outside world through NAT port-forwarding. With telnet now remotely accessible, the router's limited "ATP command line tool" (served over telnet) can be upgraded to a root shell through an injection into the ATP's hidden "ping" command.

DESCRIPTION: This module exploits a vulnerability (CVE-2020-13851) in Pandora FMS versions 7.0 NG 742, 7.0 NG 743, and 7.0 NG 744 (and perhaps older versions) in order to execute arbitrary commands. This module takes advantage of a command injection vulnerability in the `Events` feature of Pandora FMS. This flaw allows users to execute arbitrary commands via the `target` parameter in HTTP POST requests to the `Events` function. After authenticating to the target, the module attempts to exploit this flaw by issuing such an HTTP POST request, with the `target` parameter set to contain the payload. If a shell is obtained, the module will try to obtain the local MySQL database password via a simple `grep` command on the plaintext `/var/www/html/pandora_console/include/config.php` file. Valid credentials for a Pandora FMS account are required. The account does not need to have admin privileges. This module has been successfully tested on Pandora 7.0 NG 744 running on CentOS 7 (the official virtual appliance ISO for this version).

DESCRIPTION: This module exploits a stack buffer overflow in the yaSSL (1.9.8 and earlier) implementation bundled with MySQL. By sending a specially crafted client certificate, an attacker can execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is present within the CertDecoder::GetName function inside "taocrypt/src/asn.cpp". However, the stack buffer that is written to exists within a parent function's stack frame. NOTE: This vulnerability requires a non-default configuration. First, the attacker must be able to pass the host-based authentication. Next, the server must be configured to listen on an accessible network interface. Lastly, the server must have been manually configured to use SSL. The binary from version 5.5.0-m2 was built with /GS and /SafeSEH. During testing on Windows XP SP3, these protections successfully prevented exploitation. Testing was also done with mysql on Ubuntu 9.04. Although the vulnerable code is present, both version 5.5.0-m2 built from source and version 5.0.75 from a binary package were not exploitable due to the use of the compiler's FORTIFY feature. Although suse11 was mentioned in the original blog post, the binary package they provide does not contain yaSSL or support SSL.

The database backup functionality passes a user-controlled parameter, `backup_file` to the `mysqldump` command. The sanitization functionality only tests for SQL injection attempts and directory traversal, so leveraging the `-r` and `-w` `mysqldump` flags permits exploitation. The command injection vulnerability is used to write a payload on the target and achieve remote code execution as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

NAME: exploit/linux/ftp/proftp_sreplace
TYPE: exploit

ARCH: []
PLATFORM: Linux
KEYWORDS: linux ftp proftp_sreplace exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in versions 1.2 through 1.3.0 of ProFTPD server. The vulnerability is within the "sreplace" function within the "src/support.c" file. The off-by-one heap overflow bug in the ProFTPD sreplace function has been discovered about 2 (two) years ago by Evgeny Legerov. We tried to exploit this off-by-one bug via MKD command, but failed. We did not work on this bug since then. Actually, there are exists at least two bugs in sreplace function, one is the mentioned off-by-one heap overflow bug the other is a stack-based buffer overflow via 'sstrncpy(dst,src,negative argument)'. We were unable to reach the "sreplace" stack bug on ProFTPD 1.2.10 stable version, but the version 1.3.0rc3 introduced some interesting changes, among them: 1. another (integer) overflow in sreplace! 2. now it is possible to reach sreplace stack-based buffer overflow bug via the "pr_display_file" function! 3. stupid '.message' file display bug So we decided to choose ProFTPD 1.3.0 as a target for our exploit. To reach the bug, you need to upload a specially created .message file to a writeable directory, then do "CWD <writeable directory>" to trigger the invocation of sreplace function. Note that ProFTPD 1.3.0rc3 has introduced a stupid bug: to display '.message' file you also have to upload a file named '250'. ProFTPD 1.3.0 fixes this bug. The exploit is a part of VulnDisco Pack since Dec 2005.

DESCRIPTION: This module can determine what public keys are configured for key-based authentication across a range of machines, users, and sets of known keys. The SSH protocol indicates whether a particular key is accepted prior to the client performing the actual signed authentication request. To use this module, a text file containing one or more SSH keys should be provided. These can be private or public, so long as no passphrase is set on the private keys. If you have loaded a database plugin and connected to a database this module will record authorized public keys and hosts so you can track your process. Key files may be a single public (unencrypted) key, or several public keys concatenated together as an ASCII text file. Non-key data should be silently ignored. Private keys will only utilize the public key component stored within the key file.

KEYWORDS: freebsd http junos_phprc_auto_prepend_file exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits a PHP environment variable manipulation vulnerability affecting Juniper SRX firewalls and EX switches. The affected Juniper devices run FreeBSD and every FreeBSD process can access their stdin by opening /dev/fd/0. The exploit also makes use of two useful PHP features. The first being 'auto_prepend_file' which causes the provided file to be added using the 'require' function. The second PHP function is 'allow_url_include' which allows the use of URL-aware fopen wrappers. By enabling allow_url_include, the exploit can use any protocol wrapper with auto_prepend_file. The module then uses data:// to provide a file inline which includes the base64 encoded PHP payload. By default this exploit returns a session confined to a FreeBSD jail with limited functionality. There is a datastore option 'JAIL_BREAK', that when set to true, will steal the necessary tokens from a user authenticated to the J-Web application, in order to overwrite the the root password hash. If there is no user authenticated to the J-Web application this method will not work. The module then authenticates with the new root password over SSH and then rewrites the original root password hash to /etc/master.passwd.

RANK: excellent
ARCH: cmd', 'x64
PLATFORM: Unix', 'Linux
KEYWORDS: linux http cisco_asax_sfr_rce exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits an authenticated command injection vulnerability affecting Cisco ASA-X with FirePOWER Services. This exploit is executed through the ASA's ASDM web server and lands in the FirePower Services SFR module's Linux virtual machine as the root user. Access to the virtual machine allows the attacker to pivot to the inside network, and access the outside network. Also, the SFR virtual machine is running snort on the traffic flowing through the ASA, so the attacker should have access to this diverted traffic as well. This module requires ASDM credentials in order to traverse the ASDM interface. A similar attack can be performed via Cisco CLI (over SSH), although that isn't implemented here. Finally, it's worth noting that this attack bypasses the affects of the `lockdown-sensor` command (e.g. the virtual machine's bash shell shouldn't be available but this attack makes it available). Cisco assigned this issue CVE-2022-20828. The issue affects all Cisco ASA that support the ASA FirePOWER module (at least Cisco ASA-X with FirePOWER Service, and Cisco ISA 3000). The vulnerability has been patched in ASA FirePOWER module versions 6.2.3.19, 6.4.0.15, 6.6.7, and 7.0.21. The following versions will receive no patch: 6.2.2 and earlier, 6.3.*, 6.5.*, and 6.7.*.

TYPE: exploit
RANK: excellent
ARCH: cmd', 'mipsbe
PLATFORM: Unix', 'Linux
KEYWORDS: linux http zyxel_lfi_unauth_ssh_rce exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities in the `zhttpd` binary (/bin/zhttpd) and `zcmd` binary (/bin/zcmd). It is present on more than 40 Zyxel routers and CPE devices. The remote code execution vulnerability can be exploited by chaining the local file disclosure vulnerability in the zhttpd binary that allows an unauthenticated attacker to read the entire configuration of the router via the vulnerable endpoint `/Export_Log?/data/zcfg_config.json`. With this information disclosure, the attacker can determine if the router is reachable via ssh and use the second vulnerability in the `zcmd` binary to derive the `supervisor` password exploiting a weak implementation of a password derivation algorithm using the device serial number. After exploitation, an attacker will be able to execute any command as user `supervisor`.

NAME: exploit/linux/local/ptrace_traceme_pkexec_helper
TYPE: exploit
RANK: excellent
ARCH: x64
PLATFORM: Linux
KEYWORDS: linux local ptrace_traceme_pkexec_helper exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits an issue in ptrace_link in kernel/ptrace.c before Linux kernel 5.1.17. This issue can be exploited from a Linux desktop terminal, but not over an SSH session, as it requires execution from within the context of a user with an active Polkit agent. In the Linux kernel before 5.1.17, ptrace_link in kernel/ptrace.c mishandles the recording of the credentials of a process that wants to create a ptrace relationship, which allows local users to obtain root access by leveraging certain scenarios with a parent-child process relationship, where a parent drops privileges and calls execve (potentially allowing control by an attacker). One contributing factor is an object lifetime issue (which can also cause a panic). Another contributing factor is incorrect marking of a ptrace relationship as privileged, which is exploitable through (for example) Polkit's pkexec helper with PTRACE_TRACEME.

NAME: exploit/windows/local/unquoted_service_path
TYPE: exploit
RANK: great
ARCH: []
PLATFORM: Windows
KEYWORDS: windows local unquoted_service_path exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits a logic flaw due to how the lpApplicationName parameter is handled. When the lpApplicationName contains a space, the file name is ambiguous. Take this file path as example: C:\program files\hello.exe; The Windows API will try to interpret this as two possible paths: C:\program.exe, and C:\program files\hello.exe, and then execute all of them. To some software developers, this is an unexpected behavior, which becomes a security problem if an attacker is able to place a malicious executable in one of these unexpected paths, sometimes escalate privileges if run as SYSTEM. Some software such as OpenVPN 2.1.1, OpenSSH Server 5, and others have the same problem. The offensive technique is also described in Writing Secure Code (2nd Edition), Chapter 23, in the section "Calling Processes Security" on page 676. This technique was previously called Trusted Service Path, but is more commonly known as Unquoted Service Path. The service exploited won't start until the payload written to disk is removed.

If a target Windows machine is compromised and is running Pageant, this will allow the attacker to run normal OpenSSH commands (e.g. ssh-add -l) against the Pageant host which are tunneled through the meterpreter session. This could therefore be used to authenticate with a remote host using a private key which is loaded into a remote user's Pageant instance, without ever having knowledge of the private key itself.

If the letter doesn't belong to the word being extracted then all results are inverted (News #2 appears before News #1, so Pattern2 before Pattern1), instead if the letter belongs to the word being extracted then the results are in proper order (News #1 appears before News #2, so Pattern1 before Pattern2)

The 'CHECK' action (default) is used to automatically (or manually) find if directory traversal exists in the web server, and then return the path that triggers the vulnerability. The 'DOWNLOAD' action shares the same ability as 'CHECK', but will take advantage of the found trigger to download files based on a 'FILELIST' of your choosing. The 'PHPSOURCE' action can be used to download source against PHP applications. The 'WRITABLE' action can be used to determine if the trigger can be used to write files outside the www directory. To use the 'COOKIE' option, set your value like so: "name=value".

DESCRIPTION: Icingaweb versions from 2.9.0 to 2.9.5 inclusive, and 2.8.0 to 2.8.5 inclusive suffer from an unauthenticated directory traversal vulnerability. The vulnerability is triggered through the icinga-php-thirdparty library, which allows unauthenticated users to retrieve arbitrary files from the targets filesystem via a GET request to /lib/icinga/icinga-php-thirdparty/<absolute path to target file on disk> as the user running the Icingaweb server, which will typically be the www-data user. This can then be used to retrieve sensitive configuration information from the target such as the configuration of various services, which may reveal sensitive login or configuration information, the /etc/passwd file to get a list of valid usernames for password guessing attacks, or other sensitive files which may exist as part of additional functionality available on the target server. This module was tested against Icingaweb 2.9.5 running on Docker.

DESCRIPTION: TitanHQ SpamTitan Gateway is an anti-spam appliance that protects against unwanted emails and malwares. This module exploits an improper input sanitization in versions 7.01, 7.02, 7.03 and 7.07 to inject command directives into the SNMP configuration file and get remote code execution as root. Note that only version 7.03 needs authentication and no authentication is required for versions 7.01, 7.02 and 7.07. First, it sends an HTTP POST request to the `snmp-x.php` page with an `SNMPD` command directives (`extend` + command) passed to the `community` parameter. This payload is then added to `snmpd.conf` by the application. Finally, the module triggers the execution of this command by querying the SNMP server for the correct OID. This exploit module has been successfully tested against versions 7.01, 7.02, 7.03, and 7.07.

KEYWORDS: linux http cacti_unauthenticated_cmd_injection exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits an unauthenticated command injection vulnerability in Cacti through 1.2.22 (CVE-2022-46169) in order to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution as the www-data user. The module first attempts to obtain the Cacti version to see if the target is affected. If LOCAL_DATA_ID and/or HOST_ID are not set, the module will try to bruteforce the missing value(s). If a valid combination is found, the module will use these to attempt exploitation. If LOCAL_DATA_ID and/or HOST_ID are both set, the module will immediately attempt exploitation. During exploitation, the module sends a GET request to /remote_agent.php with the action parameter set to polldata and the X-Forwarded-For header set to the provided value for X_FORWARDED_FOR_IP (by default 127.0.0.1). In addition, the poller_id parameter is set to the payload and the host_id and local_data_id parameters are set to the bruteforced or provided values. If X_FORWARDED_FOR_IP is set to an address that is resolvable to a hostname in the poller table, and the local_data_id and host_id values are vulnerable, the payload set for poller_id will be executed by the target. This module has been successfully tested against Cacti version 1.2.22 running on Ubuntu 21.10 (vulhub docker image)

KEYWORDS: linux http craftcms_unauth_rce_cve_2023_41892 exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits Remote Code Execution vulnerability (CVE-2023-41892) in Craft CMS which is a popular content management system. Craft CMS versions between 4.0.0-RC1 - 4.4.14 are affected by this vulnerability allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code remotely, potentially compromising the security and integrity of the application. The vulnerability occurs using a PHP object creation in the `\craft\controllers\ConditionsController` class which allows to run arbitrary PHP code by escalating the object creation calling some methods available in `\GuzzleHttp\Psr7\FnStream`. Using this vulnerability in combination with The Imagick Extension and MSL which stands for Magick Scripting Language, a full RCE can be achieved. MSL is a built-in ImageMagick language that facilitates the reading of images, performance of image processing tasks, and writing of results back to the filesystem. This can be leveraged to create a dummy image containing malicious PHP code using the Imagick constructor class delivering a webshell that can be accessed by the attacker, thereby executing the malicious PHP code and gaining access to the system. Because of this, any remote attacker, without authentication, can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to the underlying operating system as the user that the web services are running as (typically www-data).

PLATFORM: Linux
KEYWORDS: linux http efw_chpasswd_exec exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits an OS command injection vulnerability in a web-accessible CGI script used to change passwords for locally-defined proxy user accounts. Valid credentials for such an account are required. Command execution will be in the context of the "nobody" account, but this account had broad sudo permissions, including to run the script /usr/local/bin/chrootpasswd (which changes the password for the Linux root account on the system to the value specified by console input once it is executed). The password for the proxy user account specified will *not* be changed by the use of this module, as long as the target system is vulnerable to the exploit. Very early versions of Endian Firewall (e.g. 1.1 RC5) require HTTP basic auth credentials as well to exploit this vulnerability. Use the USERNAME and PASSWORD advanced options to specify these values if required. Versions >= 3.0.0 still contain the vulnerable code, but it appears to never be executed due to a bug in the vulnerable CGI script which also prevents normal use (http://jira.endian.com/browse/UTM-1002). Versions 2.3.x and 2.4.0 are not vulnerable because of a similar bug (http://bugs.endian.com/print_bug_page.php?bug_id=3083). Tested successfully against the following versions of EFW Community: 1.1 RC5, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.5.1, 2.5.2. Should function against any version from 1.1 RC5 to 2.2.x, as well as 2.4.1 and 2.5.x.

PLATFORM: Unix
KEYWORDS: linux http ibm_qradar_unauth_rce exploit
DESCRIPTION: IBM QRadar SIEM has three vulnerabilities in the Forensics web application that when chained together allow an attacker to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution. The first stage bypasses authentication by fixating session cookies. The second stage uses those authenticated sessions cookies to write a file to disk and execute that file as the "nobody" user. The third and final stage occurs when the file executed as "nobody" writes an entry into the database that causes QRadar to execute a shell script controlled by the attacker as root within the next minute. Details about these vulnerabilities can be found in the advisories listed in References. The Forensics web application is disabled in QRadar Community Edition, but the code still works, so these vulnerabilities can be exploited in all flavours of QRadar. This module was tested with IBM QRadar CE 7.3.0 and 7.3.1. IBM has confirmed versions up to 7.2.8 patch 12 and 7.3.1 patch 3 are vulnerable. Due to payload constraints, this module only runs a generic/shell_reverse_tcp payload.

ARCH: php', 'cmd', 'x64', 'x86
PLATFORM: PHP', 'Unix', 'Linux
KEYWORDS: linux http magnusbilling_unauth_rce_cve_2023_30258 exploit
DESCRIPTION: A Command Injection vulnerability in MagnusBilling application 6.x and 7.x allows remote attackers to run arbitrary commands via unauthenticated HTTP request. A piece of demonstration code is present in `lib/icepay/icepay.php`, with a call to an exec(). The parameter to exec() includes the GET parameter `democ`, which is controlled by the user and not properly sanitised/escaped. After successful exploitation, an unauthenticated user is able to execute arbitrary OS commands. The commands run with the privileges of the web server process, typically `www-data` or `asterisk`. At a minimum, this allows an attacker to compromise the billing system and its database. The following MagnusBilling applications are vulnerable: - MagnusBilling application version 6 (all versions); - MagnusBilling application up to version 7.x without commit 7af21ed620 which fixes this vulnerability;

PLATFORM: Unix', 'Linux
KEYWORDS: linux http nagios_xi_autodiscovery_webshell exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits a path traversal issue in Nagios XI before version 5.8.5 (CVE-2021-37343). The path traversal allows a remote and authenticated administrator to upload a PHP web shell and execute code as `www-data`. The module achieves this by creating an autodiscovery job with an `id` field containing a path traversal to a writable and remotely accessible directory, and `custom_ports` field containing the web shell. A cron file will be created using the chosen path and file name, and the web shell is embedded in the file. After the web shell has been written to the victim, this module will then use the web shell to establish a Meterpreter session or a reverse shell. By default, the web shell is deleted by the module, and the autodiscovery job is removed as well.

TYPE: exploit

ARCH: []
PLATFORM: []
KEYWORDS: linux http nagios_xi_plugins_check_plugin_authenticated_rce exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits a vulnerability in the getprofile.sh script of Nagios XI prior to 5.6.6 in order to upload a malicious check_ping plugin and thereby execute arbitrary commands. For Nagios XI 5.2.0-5.4.13, the commands are run as the nagios user. For versions 5.5.0-5.6.5 the commands are run as root. Note that versions prior to 5.2.0 will still be marked as being vulnerable however this module does not presently support exploiting these targets. The module uploads a malicious check_ping plugin to the Nagios XI server via /admin/monitoringplugins.php and then executes this plugin by issuing a HTTP GET request to download a system profile from the server. For all supported targets except Linux (cmd), the module uses a command stager to write the exploit to the target via the malicious plugin. This may not work if Nagios XI is running in a restricted Unix environment, so in that case the target must be set to Linux (cmd). The module then writes the payload to the malicious plugin while avoiding commands that may not be supported. Valid credentials for a user with administrative privileges are required. This module was successfully tested on Nagios XI 5.3.0 and Nagios 5.6.5, both running on CentOS 7. For vulnerable versions before 5.5.0, it may take a significant amount of time for the payload to get back (up to 5 minutes). If exploitation fails against an older system, it is recommended to increase the WfsDelay setting (default is 300 seconds). See the documentation for more information.

NAME: exploit/linux/http/wd_mycloud_unauthenticated_cmd_injection
TYPE: exploit
RANK: excellent
ARCH: armle', 'cmd
PLATFORM: Linux', 'Unix
KEYWORDS: linux http wd_mycloud_unauthenticated_cmd_injection exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits authentication bypass (CVE-2018-17153) and command injection (CVE-2016-10108) vulnerabilities in Western Digital MyCloud before 2.30.196 in order to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution as the root user. The module first performs a check to see if the target is WD MyCloud. If so, it attempts to trigger an authentication bypass (CVE-2018-17153) via a crafted GET request to /cgi-bin/network_mgr.cgi. If the server responds as expected, the module assesses the vulnerability status by attempting to exploit a commend injection vulnerability (CVE-2016-10108) in order to print a random string via the echo command. This is done via a crafted POST request to /web/google_analytics.php. If the server is vulnerable, the same command injection vector is leveraged to execute the payload. This module has been successfully tested against Western Digital MyCloud version 2.30.183. Note: based on the available disclosures, it seems that the command injection vector (CVE-2016-10108) might be exploitable without the authentication bypass (CVE-2018-17153) on versions before 2.21.126. The obtained results on 2.30.183 imply that the patch for CVE-2016-10108 did not actually remove the command injection vector, but only prevented unauthenticated access to it.

DESCRIPTION: The exploit takes advantage of two issues in JDK 7: The ClassFinder and MethodFinder.findMethod(). Both were newly introduced in JDK 7. ClassFinder is a replacement for classForName back in JDK 6. It allows untrusted code to obtain a reference and have access to a restricted package in JDK 7, which can be used to abuse sun.awt.SunToolkit (a restricted package). With sun.awt.SunToolkit, we can actually invoke getField() by abusing findMethod() in Statement.invokeInternal() (but getField() must be public, and that's not always the case in JDK 6) in order to access Statement.acc's private field, modify AccessControlContext, and then disable Security Manager. Once Security Manager is disabled, we can execute arbitrary Java code. Our exploit has been tested successfully against multiple platforms, including: IE, Firefox, Safari, Chrome; Windows, Ubuntu, OS X, Solaris, etc.

KEYWORDS: multi http atutor_upload_traversal exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability together with a directory traversal flaw in ATutor versions 2.2.4, 2.2.2 and 2.2.1 in order to execute arbitrary commands. It first creates a zip archive containing a malicious PHP file. The zip archive takes advantage of a directory traversal vulnerability that will cause the PHP file to be dropped in the root server directory (`htdocs` for Windows and `html` for Linux targets). The PHP file contains an encoded payload that allows for remote command execution on the target server. The zip archive can be uploaded via two vectors, the `Import New Language` function and the `Patcher` function. The module first uploads the archive via `Import New Language` and then attempts to execute the payload via an HTTP GET request to the PHP file in the root server directory. If no session is obtained, the module creates another zip archive and attempts exploitation via `Patcher`. Valid credentials for an ATutor admin account are required. This module has been successfully tested against ATutor 2.2.4 running on Windows 10 (XAMPP server).

TYPE: exploit
RANK: excellent
ARCH: x86', 'x64', 'php
PLATFORM: Linux', 'Windows', 'PHP
KEYWORDS: multi http horizontcms_upload_exec exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in HorizontCMS 1.0.0-beta in order to execute arbitrary commands. The module first attempts to authenticate to HorizontCMS. It then tries to upload a malicious PHP file via an HTTP POST request to `/admin/file-manager/fileupload`. The server will rename this file to a random string. The module will therefore attempt to change the filename back to the original name via an HTTP POST request to `/admin/file-manager/rename`. For the `php` target, the payload is embedded in the uploaded file and the module attempts to execute the payload via an HTTP GET request to `/storage/file_name`. For the `linux` and `windows` targets, the module uploads a simple PHP web shell similar to `<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>`. Subsequently, it leverages the CmdStager mixin to deliver the final payload via a series of HTTP GET requests to the PHP web shell. Valid credentials for a HorizontCMS user with permissions to use the FileManager are required. This would be all users in the Admin, Manager and Editor groups if HorizontCMS is configured with the default group settings.This module has been successfully tested against HorizontCMS 1.0.0-beta running on Ubuntu 18.04.

DESCRIPTION: Joomla suffers from an unauthenticated remote code execution that affects all versions from 1.5.0 to 3.4.5. By storing user supplied headers in the databases session table it's possible to truncate the input by sending an UTF-8 character. The custom created payload is then executed once the session is read from the database. You also need to have a PHP version before 5.4.45 (including 5.3.x), 5.5.29 or 5.6.13. In later versions the deserialisation of invalid session data stops on the first error and the exploit will not work. The PHP Patch was included in Ubuntu versions 5.5.9+dfsg-1ubuntu4.13 and 5.3.10-1ubuntu3.20 and in Debian in version 5.4.45-0+deb7u1.

DESCRIPTION: Moodle version 3.9, 3.8 to 3.8.3, 3.7 to 3.7.6, 3.5 to 3.5.12 and earlier unsupported versions allow for a teacher to exploit chain to RCE. A bug in the privileges system allows a teacher to add themselves as a manager to their own class. They can then add any other users, and thus look to add someone with manager privileges on the system (not just the class). After adding a system manager, a 'loginas' feature is used to access their account. Next the system is reconfigured to allow for all users to install an addon/plugin. Then a malicious theme is uploaded and creates an RCE. If all of that is a success, we revert permissions for managers to system default and remove our malicoius theme. Manual cleanup to remove students from the class is required. This module was tested against Moodle version 3.9

Only servers with certains Nginx + PHP-FPM configurations are exploitable. This is a port of the original neex's exploit code (see refs.). First, it detects the correct parameters (Query String Length and custom header length) needed to trigger code execution. This step determines if the target is actually vulnerable (Check method). Then, the exploit sets a series of PHP INI directives to create a file locally on the target, which enables code execution through a query string parameter. This is used to execute normal payload stagers. Finally, this module does some cleanup by killing local PHP-FPM workers (those are spawned automatically once killed) and removing the created local file.

DESCRIPTION: This module exploits CVE-2023-22952, a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in SugarCRM 11.0 Enterprise, Professional, Sell, Serve, and Ultimate versions prior to 11.0.5 and SugarCRM 12.0 Enterprise, Sell, and Serve versions prior to 12.0.2. The vulnerability occurs due to a lack of appropriate validation when uploading a malicious PNG file with embedded PHP code to the /cache/images/ directory on the web server using the vulnerable endpoint /index.php?module=EmailTemplates&action=AttachFiles. Once uploaded to the server, depending on server configuration, the attacker can access the malicious PNG file via HTTP or HTTPS, thereby executing the malicious PHP code and gaining access to the system. This vulnerability does not require authentication because there is a missing authentication check in the loadUser() method in include/MVC/SugarApplication.php. After a failed login, the session does not get destroyed and hence the attacker can continue to send valid requests to the application. Because of this, any remote attacker, regardless of authentication, can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to the underlying operating system as the user that the web services are running as (typically www-data).

DESCRIPTION: This module exploits a vulnerability found in WikkaWiki. When the spam logging feature is enabled, it is possible to inject PHP code into the spam log file via the UserAgent header, and then request it to execute our payload. There are at least three different ways to trigger spam protection, this module does so by generating 10 fake URLs in a comment (by default, the max_new_comment_urls parameter is 6). Please note that in order to use the injection, you must manually pick a page first that allows you to add a comment, and then set it as 'PAGE'.

DESCRIPTION: This module exploits an unauth RCE in the WordPress plugin: Backup Migration (<= 1.3.7). The vulnerability is exploitable through the Content-Dir header which is sent to the /wp-content/plugins/backup-backup/includes/backup-heart.php endpoint. The exploit makes use of a neat technique called PHP Filter Chaining which allows an attacker to prepend bytes to a string by continuously chaining character encoding conversions. This allows an attacker to prepend a PHP payload to a string which gets evaluated by a require statement, which results in command execution.

NAME: exploit/multi/http/wp_popular_posts_rce
TYPE: exploit

KEYWORDS: multi http wp_popular_posts_rce exploit
DESCRIPTION: This exploit requires Metasploit to have a FQDN and the ability to run a payload web server on port 80, 443, or 8080. The FQDN must also not resolve to a reserved address (192/172/127/10). The server must also respond to a HEAD request for the payload, prior to getting a GET request. This exploit leverages an authenticated improper input validation in Wordpress plugin Popular Posts <= 5.3.2. The exploit chain is rather complicated. Authentication is required and 'gd' for PHP is required on the server. Then the Popular Post plugin is reconfigured to allow for an arbitrary URL for the post image in the widget. A post is made, then requests are sent to the post to make it more popular than the previous #1 by 5. Once the post hits the top 5, and after a 60sec (we wait 90) server cache refresh, the homepage widget is loaded which triggers the plugin to download the payload from our server. Our payload has a 'GIF' header, and a double extension ('.gif.php') allowing for arbitrary PHP code to be executed.

ARCH: armle', 'cmd
PLATFORM: Linux', 'Unix
KEYWORDS: unix webapp aerohive_netconfig_lfi_log_poison_rce exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits LFI and log poisoning vulnerabilities (CVE-2020-16152) in Aerohive NetConfig, version 10.0r8a build-242466 and older in order to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution as the root user. NetConfig is the Aerohive/Extreme Networks HiveOS administrative webinterface. Vulnerable versions allow for LFI because they rely on a version of PHP 5 that is vulnerable to string truncation attacks. This module leverages this issue in conjunction with log poisoning to gain RCE as root. Upon successful exploitation, the Aerohive NetConfig application may hang for as long as the spawned shell remains open. For the Linux target, the MeterpreterTryToFork option (enabled by default) will likely prevent this. If the app hangs, closing the session should render it responsive again. The module provides an automatic cleanup option to clean the log. However, this option is disabled by default because any modifications to the /tmp/messages log, even via sed, may render the target (temporarily) unexploitable. This state can last over an hour. This module has been successfully tested against Aerohive NetConfig versions 8.2r4 and 10.0r7a.

KEYWORDS: unix webapp bolt_authenticated_rce exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits multiple vulnerabilities in Bolt CMS version 3.7.0 and 3.6.* in order to execute arbitrary commands as the user running Bolt. This module first takes advantage of a vulnerability that allows an authenticated user to change the username in /bolt/profile to a PHP `system($_GET[""])` variable. Next, the module obtains a list of tokens from `/async/browse/cache/.sessions` and uses these to create files with the blacklisted `.php` extention via HTTP POST requests to `/async/folder/rename`. For each created file, the module checks the HTTP response for evidence that the file can be used to execute arbitrary commands via the created PHP $_GET variable. If the response is negative, the file is deleted, otherwise the payload is executed via an HTTP get request in this format: `/files/<rogue_PHP_file>?<$_GET_var>=<payload>` Valid credentials for a Bolt CMS user are required. This module has been successfully tested against Bolt CMS 3.7.0 running on CentOS 7.

DESCRIPTION: WordPress Shopping Cart (WP EasyCart) Plugin for WordPress contains a flaw that allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code. This flaw exists because the /inc/amfphp/administration/banneruploaderscript.php script does not properly verify or sanitize user-uploaded files. By uploading a .php file, the remote system will place the file in a user-accessible path. Making a direct request to the uploaded file will allow the attacker to execute the script with the privileges of the web server. In versions <= 3.0.8 authentication can be done by using the WordPress credentials of a user with any role. In later versions, a valid EasyCart admin password will be required that is in use by any admin user. A default installation of EasyCart will setup a user called "demouser" with a preset password of "demouser".

KEYWORDS: unix webapp wp_wysija_newsletters_upload exploit
DESCRIPTION: The Wordpress plugin "MailPoet Newsletters" (wysija-newsletters) before 2.6.8 is vulnerable to an unauthenticated file upload. The exploit uses the Upload Theme functionality to upload a zip file containing the payload. The plugin uses the admin_init hook, which is also executed for unauthenticated users when accessing a specific URL. The first fix for this vulnerability appeared in version 2.6.7, but the fix can be bypassed. In PHP's default configuration, a POST variable overwrites a GET variable in the $_REQUEST array. The plugin uses $_REQUEST to check for access rights. By setting the POST parameter to something not beginning with 'wysija_', the check is bypassed. Wordpress uses the $_GET array to determine the page, so it is not affected by this. The developers applied the fixes to all previous versions too.

KEYWORDS: windows browser adobe_flashplayer_arrayindexing exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits a vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player versions 10.3.181.23 and earlier. This issue is caused by a failure in the ActionScript3 AVM2 verification logic. This results in unsafe JIT(Just-In-Time) code being executed. This is the same vulnerability that was used for attacks against Korean based organizations. Specifically, this issue occurs when indexing an array using an arbitrary value, memory can be referenced and later executed. Taking advantage of this issue does not rely on heap spraying as the vulnerability can also be used for information leakage. Currently this exploit works for IE6, IE7, IE8, Firefox 10.2 and likely several other browsers under multiple Windows platforms. This exploit bypasses ASLR/DEP and is very reliable.

KEYWORDS: windows browser java_docbase_bof exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits a flaw in the new plugin component of the Sun Java Runtime Environment before v6 Update 22. By specifying specific parameters to the new plugin, an attacker can cause a stack-based buffer overflow and execute arbitrary code. When the new plugin is invoked with a "launchjnlp" parameter, it will copy the contents of the "docbase" parameter to a stack-buffer using the "sprintf" function. A string of 396 bytes is enough to overflow the 256 byte stack buffer and overwrite some local variables as well as the saved return address. NOTE: The string being copied is first passed through the "WideCharToMultiByte". Due to this, only characters which have a valid localized multibyte representation are allowed. Invalid characters will be replaced with question marks ('?'). This vulnerability was originally discovered independently by both Stephen Fewer and Berend Jan Wever (SkyLined). Although exhaustive testing hasn't been done, all versions since version 6 Update 10 are believed to be affected by this vulnerability. This vulnerability was patched as part of the October 2010 Oracle Patch release.

DESCRIPTION: This module exploits a use-after-free vulnerability within the DHTML behaviors functionality of Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 6 and 7. This bug was discovered being used in-the-wild and was previously known as the "iepeers" vulnerability. The name comes from Microsoft's suggested workaround to block access to the iepeers.dll file. According to Nico Waisman, "The bug itself is when trying to persist an object using the setAttribute, which end up calling VariantChangeTypeEx with both the source and the destination being the same variant. So if you send as a variant an IDISPATCH the algorithm will try to do a VariantClear of the destination before using it. This will end up on a call to PlainRelease which deref the reference and clean the object." NOTE: Internet Explorer 8 and Internet Explorer 5 are not affected.

DESCRIPTION: This module exploits an integer overflow vulnerability on Internet Explorer. The vulnerability exists in the handling of the dashstyle.array length for vml shapes on the vgx.dll module. The exploit has been built and tested specifically against Windows 7 SP1 with Internet Explorer 8. It uses either JRE6 or an information leak (to ntdll) to bypass ASLR, and by default the info leak is used. To make sure the leak is successful, the ntdll version should be either v6.1.7601.17514 (the default dll version on a newly installed/unpatched Windows 7 SP1), or ntdll.dll v6.1.7601.17725 (installed after apply MS12-001). If the target doesn't have the version the exploit wants, it will refuse to attack by sending a fake 404 message (webpage not found). If you wish to try the JRE6 component instead to bypass ASLR, you can set the advanced datastore option to 'JRE6'. If JRE6 is chosen but the target doesn't have this particular component, the exploit will also refuse to attack by sending a 404 message.

DESCRIPTION: This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in WebEx's WebexUCFObject ActiveX Control. If a long string is passed to the 'NewObject' method, a stack- based buffer overflow will occur when copying attacker-supplied data using the sprintf function. It is noteworthy that this vulnerability was discovered and reported by multiple independent researchers. To quote iDefense's advisory, "Before this issue was publicly reported, at least three independent security researchers had knowledge of this issue; thus, it is reasonable to believe that even more people were aware of this issue before disclosure." NOTE: Due to input restrictions, this exploit uses a heap-spray to get the payload into memory unmodified.

KEYWORDS: windows browser wmi_admintools exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits a memory trust issue in the Microsoft WMI Administration tools ActiveX control. When processing a specially crafted HTML page, the WEBSingleView.ocx ActiveX Control (1.50.1131.0) will treat the 'lCtxHandle' parameter to the 'AddContextRef' and 'ReleaseContext' methods as a trusted pointer. It makes an indirect call via this pointer which leads to arbitrary code execution. This exploit utilizes a combination of heap spraying and the .NET 2.0 'mscorie.dll' module to bypass DEP and ASLR. This module does not opt-in to ASLR. As such, this module should be reliable on all Windows versions. The WMI Administrative Tools are a standalone download & install (linked in the references).

DESCRIPTION: This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in the handling of the 'pFragments' shape property within the Microsoft Word RTF parser. All versions of Microsoft Office 2010, 2007, 2003, and XP prior to the release of the MS10-087 bulletin are vulnerable. This module does not attempt to exploit the vulnerability via Microsoft Outlook. The Microsoft Word RTF parser was only used by default in versions of Microsoft Word itself prior to Office 2007. With the release of Office 2007, Microsoft began using the Word RTF parser, by default, to handle rich-text messages within Outlook as well. It was possible to configure Outlook 2003 and earlier to use the Microsoft Word engine too, but it was not a default setting. It appears as though Microsoft Office 2000 is not vulnerable. It is unlikely that Microsoft will confirm or deny this since Office 2000 has reached its support cycle end-of-life.

TYPE: exploit
RANK: great
ARCH: []
PLATFORM: Windows
KEYWORDS: windows fileformat visiwave_vwr_type exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits a vulnerability found in VisiWave's Site Survey Report application. When processing .VWR files, VisiWaveReport.exe attempts to match a valid pointer based on the 'Type' property (valid ones include 'Properties', 'TitlePage', 'Details', 'Graph', 'Table', 'Text', 'Image'), but if a match isn't found, the function that's supposed to handle this routine ends up returning the input as a pointer, and later used in a CALL DWORD PTR [EDX+10] instruction. This allows attackers to overwrite it with any arbitrary value, and results code execution. A patch is available at visiwave.com; the fix is done by XORing the return value as null if no match is found, and then it is validated before use. NOTE: During installation, the application will register two file handles, VWS and VWR, which allows a victim user to 'double click' the malicious VWR file and execute code. This module was also built to bypass ASLR and DEP.

NAME: exploit/windows/http/serviio_checkstreamurl_cmd_exec
TYPE: exploit
RANK: excellent
ARCH: []
PLATFORM: Windows
KEYWORDS: windows http serviio_checkstreamurl_cmd_exec exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits an unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability in the console component of Serviio Media Server versions 1.4 to 1.8 on Windows operating systems. The console service (on port 23423 by default) exposes a REST API which which does not require authentication. The 'action' API endpoint does not sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data in the 'VIDEO' parameter of the 'checkStreamUrl' method. This parameter is used in a call to cmd.exe resulting in execution of arbitrary commands. This module has been tested successfully on Serviio Media Server versions 1.4.0, 1.5.0, 1.6.0 and 1.8.0 on Windows 7.

TYPE: exploit

ARCH: x86', 'x64
PLATFORM: Windows
KEYWORDS: windows http trendmicro_officescan_widget_exec exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits the authentication bypass and command injection vulnerability together. Unauthenticated users can execute a terminal command under the context of the web server user. The specific flaw exists within the management interface, which listens on TCP port 443 by default. The Trend Micro Officescan product has a widget feature which is implemented with PHP. Talker.php takes ack and hash parameters but doesn't validate these values, which leads to an authentication bypass for the widget. Proxy.php files under the mod TMCSS folder take multiple parameters but the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. Due to combination of these vulnerabilities, unauthenticated users can execute a terminal command under the context of the web server user.

NAME: exploit/windows/smb/timbuktu_plughntcommand_bof

RANK: great
ARCH: []
PLATFORM: Windows
KEYWORDS: windows smb timbuktu_plughntcommand_bof exploit
DESCRIPTION: This module exploits a stack based buffer overflow in Timbuktu Pro version <= 8.6.6 in a pretty novel way. This exploit requires two connections. The first connection is used to leak stack data using the buffer overflow to overwrite the nNumberOfBytesToWrite argument. By supplying a large value for this argument it is possible to cause Timbuktu to reply to the initial request with leaked stack data. Using this data allows for reliable exploitation of the buffer overflow vulnerability. Props to Infamous41d for helping in finding this exploitation path. The second connection utilizes the data from the data leak to accurately exploit the stack based buffer overflow vulnerability. TODO: hdm suggested using meterpreter's migration capability and restarting the process for multishot exploitation.
